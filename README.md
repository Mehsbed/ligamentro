## 📱 Overview

Ligamentro is an advanced Android application that leverages machine learning and computer vision to detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time. The app uses the device's camera to capture hand movements and translates them into text, making communication more accessible for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Sign Language Detection**: Instant recognition of sign language gestures using the device's camera
- **High Accuracy**: Powered by TensorFlow Lite for precise gesture recognition
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet connection once the model is downloaded
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive UI design
- **Multiple Sign Language Support**: Currently supports American Sign Language (ASL)
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient processing for smooth real-time detection

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Minimum SDK**: Android 6.0 (API level 23)
- **Target SDK**: Android 13 (API level 33)
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **ML Framework**: TensorFlow Lite
- **Image Processing**: CameraX API
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt
- **Coroutines**: For asynchronous operations
- **Material Design**: For modern UI components
